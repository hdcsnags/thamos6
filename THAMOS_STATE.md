# ThamOS v6 — Project State & Sprint Tracker

> **Last Updated:** 2026-05-04 by Kimi Code CLI (Desktop UI/UX Audit + Documentation Sprint)
> 
> **Purpose:** This document tracks the current state of ThamOS v6, documents completed work, pending features, known bugs, and UI/UX audit findings. Any agent starting cold on this project should read this file **after** `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_V2.md`, and `MODULAR_GUIDE.md` to understand what has been done and what remains.

## Interface Overview

ThamOS v6 has **four themes/interfaces**, not two as documented in the stale architecture guides:

| Theme | Location | Status | Description |
|-------|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Tactical** | `src/components/Layout.tsx` | ✅ Stable | Modern card-based GUI. Default theme. |
| **Terminal** | `src/components/terminallayout.tsx` | ✅ Stable | Retro CLI with `scan` commands, flags, history. |
| **Desktop** | `src/components/desktop/` | ✅ Active / Most Complete | Full windowed OS environment. **Currently the primary active theme at t6.thamOS.ca.** |
| **Mission Control** | `src/contexts/themecontext.tsx` | ⚠️ Stub | Exists in theme type but minimal implementation. |

**The architecture docs (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_V2.md`, `MODULAR_GUIDE.md`) are stale** — they only document Tactical and Terminal modes. The Desktop theme is entirely absent from documentation until this audit.

---

## UI/UX Audit Findings

> **Audited by:** Kimi Code CLI, 2026-05-04
> **Benchmark:** Ubuntu Tour (malisipi/ubuntu-tour), WebVM 2.0, general desktop OS realism standards
> **Method:** Deep code review of `src/components/desktop/*`, `src/contexts/DesktopContext.tsx`, `src/design-system/*`, live functionality assessment.

### Grades

| Category | Grade | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **UX Polish** | B+ | Excellent snap previews, hover traffic lights, glassmorphism, context menus everywhere. Missing minimize animations, window dimensions in title bar are dev-facing clutter. |
| **Visual Hierarchy** | B | Great color system (`tokens.ts`), elevation layers, active/inactive differentiation. **Crippled by emoji icons.** Static unchangeable wallpaper. |
| **Window Management** | A- | 8-direction resize, snap-to-edge (top/left/right/corners), cascading open, z-index stack, pinned windows, layout persistence, Ctrl+Arrow tiling. No Mission Control/Exposé view, no split-view sync. |
| **Animations** | B+ | Spring window-open, launcher scale-in, workspace flash, boot fade-ins. **No minimize/maximize transitions** — instant snap. No window shake on error. |
| **Iconography** | D+ | **All app icons are Unicode emojis** (`⌘`, `🔍`, `🌐`, `📝`, `⚙️`). Renders inconsistently across OSes. No unified SVG set. **#1 visual blocker.** |
| **Terminal Authenticity** | A | Custom CLI (22 commands + tab completion + history) AND real `xterm.js` VPS terminal with WebSocket/Cloudflare Tunnel. Best-in-class for browser OS. |
| **Taskbar Behavior** | B+ | Launcher, 4 workspaces with dots, window list, agent status dots, notification bell with unread badge, live clock. Missing window grouping, jump lists, volume/network/battery tray icons. |
| **Workspace Switching** | B+ | 4 desks, Ctrl+1-4, pinned windows跨workspaces, flash indicator. No workspace thumbnails/previews, no drag-to-move between workspaces. |
| **System Tray Realism** | C+ | Agent dots + bell + clock. No volume, network, battery, calendar popover. No Do Not Disturb. |

### Critical Issues (Fix First)

1. **Emoji Iconography** — Replace all 12 app icons in `appRegistry.ts` with custom SVGs. This is the highest-ROI visual fix.
2. **Minimize/Maximize Animations** — Windows snap instantly. Add 200ms CSS scale/translate transitions.
3. **Wallpaper Customization** — Background is hardcoded gradient in `DesktopLayout.tsx`. Add wallpaper picker + 3-4 options.
4. **Remove Pixel Dimensions from Title Bar** — `900x600` in `DesktopWindow.tsx` title bar is developer clutter.

### High Priority Issues

5. **Mission Control / Window Overview** — No way to see all windows at once.
6. **Desktop Icon Drag-and-Drop** — Icons are fixed top-left grid. Users expect to rearrange.
7. **Taskbar Window Grouping** — 3 terminals = 3 buttons. Group by app + expand on hover.
8. **Calendar Popover on Clock Click** — Standard OS behavior, easy win.
9. **Desktop-Styled Result Pages** — Tactical `IPResult`/`URLResult` reused in desktop windows look visually inconsistent.
10. **True Window Transparency / Acrylic** — `backdropFilter: blur(24px)` with solid bg. Let wallpaper bleed through.

### Medium Priority Issues

11. System tray expansion (volume, network, battery mocks).
12. Browser renders real web pages (currently `thamos://` only).
13. Notification badges on app icons.
14. Window snap divider sync (resize one snapped window, neighbor adjusts).
15. Screensaver / lock screen.
16. **Dead code cleanup** — `src/components/DesktopLayout.tsx` (old monolithic 561-line version) is unused.
17. **Update architecture docs** — They don't mention Desktop or Mission Control.

### Bugs Found During Audit

- `extension-result` handled in `renderWindowContent` but **missing from `AppId` type** in `DesktopContext.tsx`.
- `src/components/DesktopLayout.tsx` (old) is **dead code** — superseded by `src/components/desktop/DesktopLayout.tsx`.
- Architecture docs are **100% silent** on Desktop theme and `mission-control` theme.

## Integration Roadmap

> See **`INTEGRATION_ROADMAP.md`** for the complete feasibility analysis and phased implementation plan.
> 
> **Summary:** Integration with TopDesk (ticketing), Entra ID (remediation), Sentinel (SIEM/playbooks), and Defender (email investigation) is **technically feasible**. TopDesk and Entra are the highest-ROI, lowest-effort integrations. Email deep-link analysis is the most complex.

### 🔴 Phase 1 — TopDesk + Entra Guard (High Priority)
- [ ] **TopDesk Desktop app** — Search incidents by UPN, deduplication, enrichment, close/update
- [ ] **Entra Guard Desktop app** — Revoke sessions, force password reset, view sign-in logs, disable account
- [ ] **Analyst API credential storage** — Encrypted `analyst_api_credentials` table in Supabase
- [ ] **Supabase Edge Functions** — `topdesk/*`, `entra/*`
- [ ] **Settings panel expansion** — API key/config forms for TopDesk and Entra

### 🟡 Phase 2 — Sentinel Console (Medium Priority)
- [ ] **Sentinel Desktop app** — Incident list, KQL query runner, playbook trigger
- [ ] **Pre-built KQL library** — Adopt `security-investigator` query pattern with metadata headers
- [ ] **Logic App webhook integration** — Trigger remediation playbooks from ThamOS UI

### 🟢 Phase 3 — Email Investigator (Lower Priority)
- [ ] **Email Investigator Desktop app** — Defender email search, detonation results
- [ ] **Attachment extraction pipeline** — Fetch attachments from mailbox or eDiscovery
- [ ] **URL extraction from PDF/DOCX** — Custom parser Edge Function
- [ ] **Redirect chain follower** — Recursive HTTP hop tracker
- [ ] **Third-party sandbox integration** — URLScan.io, VirusTotal for URL detonation

### 🔵 Phase 4 — AI Summaries (Future)
- [ ] **Ticket correlation narrative** — "This UPN has 3 tickets, 2 Sentinel incidents, flagged by AbuseIPDB"
- [ ] **Auto-generated closure notes** — One-click generate TopDesk action note with reasoning
- [ ] **KQL query explanation** — Plain English description of pre-built queries

## Sprint Log

### Sprint 2026-05-04 — UI/UX Audit & Documentation
**Agent:** Kimi Code CLI
**Scope:** Frontend-focused audit of Desktop theme. No backend/Supabase changes.

**Completed:**
- Deep audit of entire Desktop theme codebase (`src/components/desktop/*`, `DesktopContext.tsx`, `appRegistry.ts`, `tokens.ts`)
- Graded 9 categories of UI/UX realism against browser-OS benchmarks
- Identified 4 critical issues, 8 high-priority issues, 10 medium-priority issues
- Found 3 bugs during audit (`extension-result` type missing, dead code, stale docs)
- Created `THAMOS_STATE.md` (this document)
- Created `AGENTS.md` operational standards
- Updated `ARCHITECTURE.md` to include Desktop and Mission Control themes
- Updated `ARCHITECTURE_V2.md` to include Desktop architecture
- Updated `MODULAR_GUIDE.md` to include Desktop module

**Decisions Made:**
- Prioritized iconography replacement as #1 visual fix (highest ROI)
- Documented Desktop theme as the most complete of the four themes
- Mission Control theme exists as a stub; documented but not prioritized

### Sprint 2026-05-04 — Desktop Critical Polish
**Agent:** Kimi Code CLI
**Scope:** All 4 critical UX/UI issues from audit + 2 bugs

**Completed:**
- Built custom SVG icon set (12 outline-style icons in `src/design-system/icons.tsx`)
- Replaced all emoji icons across appRegistry, DesktopIcons, Taskbar, Window chrome, AppLauncher, Spotlight
- Added minimize animation (scale+fade, 200ms) and maximize/restore transitions (250ms position/size)
- Built wallpaper system (`src/design-system/wallpapers.ts`) with 6 CSS wallpapers + preview swatches
- Added wallpaper picker to Settings > Appearance with live update via custom event
- Removed pixel dimensions from window title bar
- Fixed `extension-result` missing from `AppId` union type
- Deleted dead code `src/components/DesktopLayout.tsx` (old monolithic version)
- Committed and pushed to GitHub (hdcsnags/thamos6.git)

**Decisions Made:**
- Icons stored as `React.FC<IconProps>` in registry (not rendered nodes) so each consumer can set its own size
- Wallpaper system uses CSS-only backgrounds (no image assets needed) for zero bundle impact
- Custom event `thamos:wallpaper-changed` used for cross-component wallpaper sync without prop drilling

**Next Sprint Candidates:**
1. Mission Control overlay + desktop icon drag-and-drop
2. Desktop-styled result pages (IPResult/URLResult wrappers)
3. System tray expansion (volume, network, battery)

### Sprint 2026-05-04 — TopDesk Integration + Build Fixes
**Agent:** Kimi Code CLI
**Scope:** TopDesk Desktop App, build fixes, clean boot state, settings integration

**Completed:**
- Removed forced Terminal + System Monitor open on fresh boot → clean desktop by default
- Fixed build error: `src/pages/DesktopScanner.tsx` imported deleted `DesktopLayout.tsx` — replaced with local AGENTS/P definitions
- Fixed build error: `appRegistry.ts` had `SearchResultIcon({ size: 20 })` function calls instead of component references
- Built `TopDeskIcon` SVG in `icons.tsx` (ticket/helpdesk style outline icon)
- Added `topdesk` to `AppId` union type in `DesktopContext.tsx`
- Registered `topdesk` app in `appRegistry.ts` with blue accent, desktop icon enabled
- Created `DesktopTopDesk.tsx` with full mock-data UI:
  - UPN search bar with loading state
  - Incident list with status badges, duplicate markers, primary auto-selection
  - Detail view with action notes, category, operator info
  - Deduplication panel: shows duplicate tickets, [CLOSE DUPLICATES & MERGE] button
  - [ENRICH] button for adding ThamOS scan results to primary ticket
  - [CLOSE AS BENIGN] and [ESCALATE] action buttons
  - Toast notifications for actions
- Added TopDesk configuration UI in Settings > Connections:
  - URL, username, application password fields
  - Save to localStorage
  - Visual active/inactive status indicator
- Created Supabase Edge Function stubs:
  - `supabase/functions/topdesk/search-incidents.ts`
  - `supabase/functions/topdesk/update-incident.ts`
  - `supabase/functions/topdesk/deduplicate.ts`

**Decisions Made:**
- TopDesk App uses mock data for now; Edge Functions are ready for real API integration
- Credentials stored in localStorage for rapid iteration; will migrate to encrypted Supabase table when API integration is live
- Primary ticket auto-selected as newest open ticket; duplicates flagged via `isDuplicate` property

**Next Sprint Candidates:**
1. Wire TopDesk App to real Edge Functions (needs school board TopDesk credentials)
2. Entra Guard app (session revoke, password reset)
3. Azure Web App sister project (secure proxy for Microsoft APIs)

---

**Next Sprint Candidates:**
1. Mission Control overlay + desktop icon drag-and-drop (Week 2 features)
2. Desktop-styled result pages + system tray expansion (Week 3 integration)

## Agent Operating Notes

### For New Agents Starting Cold

1. **Read in this order:**
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md` (system overview)
   - `ARCHITECTURE_V2.md` (V2 scanner architecture)
   - `MODULAR_GUIDE.md` (module breakdown)
   - `THAMOS_STATE.md` (this file — current state & audit)
   - `AGENTS.md` (operational standards)

2. **Four themes exist**, not two. Desktop is the most complete and currently active.

3. **Before modifying Desktop theme components**, check `src/design-system/tokens.ts` and `src/design-system/appRegistry.ts` — these are the source of truth for colors, typography, and app metadata.

4. **The `DesktopContext` is the window manager.** Any window lifecycle changes go through it.

5. **When you complete a code sprint**, append a new entry to the **Sprint Log** section above with:
   - Date, agent name, scope
   - What was completed
   - Any architectural decisions made
   - What was intentionally deferred

6. **Do not modify architecture docs without updating `THAMOS_STATE.md`** to reflect the change.

7. **Dead code to avoid:** `src/components/DesktopLayout.tsx` (old monolithic version). Use `src/components/desktop/DesktopLayout.tsx` instead.
